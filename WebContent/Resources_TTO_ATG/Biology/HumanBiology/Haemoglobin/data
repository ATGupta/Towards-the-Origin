<h2 style="text-align: center">HAEMOGLOBIN</h2>

<p style="text-align: right">2018-03

<p>Its made up of four amino acid chains. In each of those chains, there is a heme group. So there are four heme groups, and the globin describes the protein structures of it - the four peptide chains.

<p>In chlorophyll, we have magnesium ion; for the haemoglobin, we have an iron ion, where the oxygen binds. At each heme group, there is an iron ion attached to it. There are four major binding sites for oxygen in the haemoglobin.

<p>Each red blood cell has 270 million haemoglobin proteins. When an oxygen atom binds at a cite of haemoglobin, it changes the shape of haemoglobin in such a way that the other sites are more likely to accept an oxygen atom. This is called cooperative binding.

<p><b>Allosteric inhibition</b>

<p>Negative allosteric modulation (also known as allosteric inhibition) occurs when the binding of one ligand decreases the affinity for substrate at other active sites.
<p>Haemoglobin is allosterically inhibited by <i>CO<sub>2</sub></i>, and by protons. These things bond at other sites of the protein and it makes it difficult to hold oxygen.
<p>Wherever there is need of <i>O</i>, or a lot of work is being done, an acidic environment forms, for example, lactic acid is produced. This makes haemoglobin to dump its oxygen on those particular sites.

<br><i>(in the presence of carbonic anhydrase)</i>
<p>Carbonic anhydrase is present in RBCs, which converts <i>CO<sub>2</sub></i> into <i>H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub></i>. Then it releases H+. These allosterically inhibit the uptake of oxygen.
