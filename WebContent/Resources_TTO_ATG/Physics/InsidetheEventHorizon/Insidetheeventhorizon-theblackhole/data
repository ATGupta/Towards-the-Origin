<h2 style="text-align: center">INSIDE THE EVENT HORIZON: THE BLACK HOLE</h2>

<p style="text-align: right">2017-10

<h3><p style="text-align: center">Abstract</h3>

<p>From outside the event horizon, we see the black hole as a perfect black body, eating everything whatever it can. If we go inside a black body, we can see the rest of the universe as a perfect white body, emitting whatever it can, massive amounts of energy towards us. Such a body is also called white hole.
<p>We will be able to see that this energy is being concentrated towards a single point, a single object, the shape of a perfect sphere.
<p>Quantum fluctuations happen inside the black hole, leading to creation of positive and negative energies, which eventually cancel each other.

<h3><p>1. Introduction</h3>

<p>A black hole is theoretically thought of as a region of spacetime from which no matter or electromagnetic radiation can escape. Their presence was predicted well back in eighteenth century by Michell and Laplace (Montgomery et al, 2009).
<p>Schwarzschild radius, or the gravitational radius <i>r<sub>g</sub></i> is the radius below which, if a body of mass <i>M</i>, has its radius, the escape velocity will reach the speed of light <i>c</i>. Karl Schwarzschild, a German astronomer calculated this exact solution for the theory of general relativity in 1916 (Kutner, 2003). The Schwarzschild radius is given as

<p style="text-align: center"><i>r<sub>g</sub> = <sup>2GM</sup> &frasl; <sub>c<sup>2</sup></sub></i>

<p>where G is the gravitational constant.
<p>It was interpreted by David Finkelstein in 1958 that a body of radius less than <i>r<sub>g</sub></i> will produce such a region of space from which nothing can escape.
<p>Complementarily, white holes were predicted from Einstein field equations (Carroll, 2004). Since then, the nature and existence of white holes has been of a great debate.
<p>A few papers (discussed in the literature, section 2) opine that the universe is a white hole in itself. On the other hand, Hawking, 1976, opine that the black hole and the white hole are the same bodies.
<p>This paper proposes that inside of a black hole, we experience a white hole from outside. That is, from the reference frame outside the black hole, starting from the event horizon, a black body can be observed; from the same event horizon the rest of universe will seem like a perfect white body, giving away enormous amounts of energy.

<h3><p>2. Literature</h3>

<p>There are papers which hypothesize the possibility of white holes, or perfect white bodies, tending to persist on their presence in two ways. First, considering the universe as a white hole, and second, considering the black holes as white holes.

<p><b>A. The universe as a white hole</b>

<p>Brans and Dicke (1961) experimentally showed that the universe obeys machian relation.
<p style="text-align: center"><i>R ~ GM</i>
<p>Pathria (1972) showed that a pressureless closed universe is inside a black (or white) hole. Berman (2007) showed that both closed and flat universe which follow Einstein field equations are white holes themselves.

<p><b>B. Black hole is white hole</b>

<p>The black hole emits Hawking radiation and so can come to thermal equilibrium with a gas of radiation. This is allowed in quantum mechanics.
<p>In Hawking radiation, it is proposed that the reverse of a black hole in thermal equilibrium is again a black hole because a thermal equilibrium state is a time reversal invariant. This implies that the black hole and the white hole is the same object.

<h3><p>3. Discussion</h3>

<p>There has been a lot of discussion about the nature of space and everything else inside a black hole.

<p><b>A. Reference frame inside the event horizon</b>

<p>Moving our frame of reference inside the event horizon, if we look beyond the tangent of the equigravitational sphere (see figure 1), we will find that electromagnetic radiation coming towards us. If we look inside that sphere, we will still find that we are standing on a black hole; the point of the frame of reference will have an escape velocity greater than the speed of light.

<p>It could be seen that the photons that are falling, reach the speed of light and then fall with a constant velocity of <i>c</i>, because space itself does not allow any speed exceeding <i>c</i>. Below the tangent, nothing can be seen, because anything that goes down does not come back.
<p>Because of the enormous acceleration being applied to the original photos, additional photons are created to compensate the force. Quantum fluctuations happen when the photons exceed the standard speed of light, leading to the creation of what we should call the negative energy, which will destroy the extra photons produced because of space not allowing the photons to exceed <i>c</i>, but the gravity forcing to make that happen, thus following law of conservation of energy.
<p>In other words, the photon which exceeds <i>c</i>, comes back to <i>c</i>, producing another photon of positive energy and as a result, a photon of negative energy is also created due to the quantum fluctuation.
<p>We may observe the photons coming from inside towards us, but they never escape the gravitational field, so they have to fall back inside.

<h3><p>4. Conclusion</h3>

<p>Like from outside the black hole, we can see it as a body which eats everything that it can, we will be able to see the universe outside the equigravitational sphere, or anywhere inside the space of the black hole, to be a white hole from the the point of reference inside the event horizon that we have considered, giving away everything (enormous amount of energies) that it can.
<p>Quantum fluctuations in photons could also be observed inside a black hole, allowing production of extraneous positive and negative energy which will cancel each other, thus following the law of conservation of energy.
