<p>Einstein (1916) initiated the modern form of physics and cosmology through the general theory of relativity. Lemaître (1927) derived from his equations that the universe must be expanding, reducing the theory down to the origin of universe from a big bang.
<p>Hubble (1929) gave a table of certain stars and nebulae whose distances were measured along with their velocities relative to the sun. Radial velocities of 46 extra-galactic  nebulae were available till then, but individual distances had been estimated only for 24, which were given in his paper. The list contained objects from S. Mag. (min. Distance, from the sun, in the table), 0.032 &#215 10<sup>6</sup> parsecs, to N. G. C. 4649 (max. distance), 2.0 &#215 10<sup>6</sup> parsecs, were given. Also, a list of 22 objects was also given, whose distances were estimated from their velocities from sun. The best fit line demonstrated a constant increase in the speed of the objects as they move away from the sun, the mean being 500 km/sec increase in speed for increase in each distance of about 10<sup>6</sup> parsecs. This observation was based on derivations from redshifted nebular spectra.
<p>Fillmore and Goldreich (1984) have derived similarity solutions from the equations that describe the Einstein-de Sitter universe. These solutions opine he collapse of cold, collisionless matter in such a universe.
