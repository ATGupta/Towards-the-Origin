<h2 style="text-align: center">BASIC DEFINITIONS AND SYNOPSIS</h2>
<p style="text-align: right">2017-09
<p><b>Definitions</b>

<p><b>Quark:</b> The collective noun given to elementary particles of an atom.
<br><b>Baryon:</b> The matter which we observe. The matter which is made up of the 
<br><b>Hubble's constant, Lambda &#923, Omega &#937:</b> Hubble's constant - the rate of expansion of the universe; lambda - the cosmological constant; omega - average matter density in the universe

<p><b>Types of Universes</b>

<p>There are three supposed types of universes - open, flat and closed. An open universe will continue to accelerate its expansion rate forever; a flat one will continue to expand with the some rate, slowing down, but never actually stopping; and a closed universe will ultimately decrease its expansion rate with time. Here, it has also ben proposed that a flat universe can convert to a closed universe, if the space density decreases; or otherwise it can convert into an open universe if in future, the space density increases. This space density is responsible for the expansion of the universe.
<p>Quarks, for example, know about the presence of each other because of the e.m. waves they emit. This causes motion (displacement, vibration, oscillation) and thus, temperature. At absolute zero, for example, there is no such propagation of any wave. What then?
<p>Quantum fluctuations, empty space can create particles and fields.

<p><b>The quantum mechanics</b>

<p>Edwin Schrodinger gave an equation.
<p style="text-align: center"><i><sup>-&#1115</sup> &frasl; <sub>2m</sub> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <sup> &#948 <sup>2</sup> &#966 </sup> &frasl; <sub> &#948 x <sup>2</sub></sub> &nbsp;&nbsp; + v &#966 &nbsp;&nbsp; = &nbsp;&nbsp; i &#1115 &nbsp;&nbsp; <sup> &#948 &#966 </sup> &frasl; <sub>&#948 t</sub></i>
<p>Even E.S. could not explain what this is. He said that &#966 (psi) corresponds to charge density, i.e. charge of an electron is distributed over space.
<p>Max Born actually explained it. |(&#966;x)|<sup>2</sup>corresponds to probability density. The wave function does not tell where electron is going to be. It just tells probability of (us) finding it there.
<p>Werner Karl Heisenberg gave the principle of uncertainty, which states that the position and the momentum of a particle cannot be known at the same time. The uncertainty in the position &#916;x and the uncertainty in momentum &#916;&#961; can be written in the form of an equation as follows.
<p style="text-align: center"><i> &#916;x &#916;&#961; &#8805 <sup>&#1115</sup>&frasl;<sub>4&#960<sub></i>
<p>where &#1115 is the planck's constant. This also means that the uncertainty in finding the position of a particle and the uncertainty of finding the momentum of that particle are inversely proportional to each other.
<p>Now the real thing.
<br>The empty space is not empty. The vacuum we observe has energy. Quantum fluctuations happen around us. What is a Quantum fluctuation? It means that for very short time, an electron, for example, travels through the space with speed greater than that of light.
<p>Now, nothing travels beyond the speed of light. We get this from relativity.
<p style="text-align: center"><i>m = <sup>m<sub>0</sub></sup> &frasl; <sub>&#8730;(-v<sup>2</sup>c<sup>2</sup>)<sub></i>
<p>When an electron exceeds the speed of light is becomes a positron. (Feynman) A positron is antiparticle of electron.
<p>This fluctuation happens for a time so short that we cannot probe it using our current apparatus.
<p>And who in the hell gave the concept of antimatter? Paul Adrien Maurice Dirac combined E.S.'s equations with A.E.'s relativity, and finally suggested for the presence of positron. Thus there must exist antiparticle for every particle.

<p><b>Hawking Radiation</b>

<p>Given by Stephen Hawking, off course. This is what made him too famous. It is a story of black holes. This is what makes him so great that we are bound to listen to his "shit" whatever he speaks. Ohh sorry!! he cannot speak; whatever he thinks. And waste our taxes for that (again) shitty computer to facilitate him round the clock. Just kidding.! He is really, though sophistically, great.
<p>So here it goes.
<br>Because of quantum fluctuation, an electron and a positron, for example, are created at the event horizon. The electron moves away from the black hole. The positron goes into the b.h. As a system of electron-positron and b.h.-positron, the potential energy of the b.h. decreases which in correspondence gives the kinetic energy to the electron to escape from the black hole.
<p>This can happen to any type of baryon which is created near the event horizon.
<p>This says that the more matter we give into the b.h., the more its energy decreases.
<p>And guess what, scientists have even observed matter to be emitted from a b.h. And Indian scientist, Abhas Mitra from BARC, observed this. The papers which I was reading throughout the train journey of our trip to M.P. were his papers only.

<p><b>Big Bang and the expansion of the universe</b>

<p>Georges Lemaître worked on A.E.'s theory of relativity and concluded that the universe must be expanding or contracting. Then Hubble found out the through Hubble's telescope that the universe is expanding. Lemaître published his work.
<p>Einstein told him "Your math is correct, but your physics is abominable."

<p><b>What is happening to the size of the universe?</b>

<p>The supernova cosmology project (date/time not defined) determined that the universe was flat.
<p>After that, Schmidt's group (1998) published a paper which demonstrated that the universe is accelerating.
<p>Numerous papers have been published indicating that the universe is accelerating.

<p><b>Bosonic String Theory</b>

<p>This is what we both, you and I, have no idea about what happened after the AE's theory of general relativity and the theory of big bang. Whatever happened was filthy though. If you ask me, it had become a game of mathematics more than it was physics.

<p><b>DISCUSSION, ATG</b>
<p><b>Inside and outside the event horizon: the black hole</b>

<p>From outside the event horizon, we see the black hole as a perfect black body, eating everything whatever it can. If we go inside a black body, we can see the rest of the universe as a perfect white body, emitting whatever it can, massive amounts of energy towards us. It is also called white hole (hypothetical, well till now it is..) among the scientists.
<p>Also, we will be able to see that this energy is being concentrated towards a single point, a single object, the shape of a perfect sphere.
<p>So, as the mass of this point of singularity will increase, the diameter of the event horizon will increase.
<p>We were not able to find any of the perfect white body in contrary to the black bodies that exist around us because of the fact that we live in that thing what we supposedly call a perfect white body.
<p>But they say that the energy of the black hole decreases the more matter it eats. What about that?
<p>If we see Hawking radiation for a different view, it could be concluded that for the system of that black hole, the particle and the antiparticle (the electron and the positron, as I stated in the example above), the PE of the b.h. decreases. But if we consider a fourth body outside that system, we will be able to clearly calculate that the mass of b.h. has increased because the positron went inside. So, the PE of b.h. with respect to that fourth body will increase.

<p><b>Review on observations</b>

<p>The results for the quest to determine the nature of our universe started with [1]. Well I am trying to understand the observations, and from a few other papers too. But the actuality is that, mathematics has been way more complicated after Einstein. Actually, since the industrial revolution itself, all the time when the English were ruling India, mathematics was becoming more and more complicated. I am pausing this for some time. I think I will take a break and read biology for some time.
<p>The above paragraph, Inside and outside the event horizon: the black hole, is a paper in itself. But I have to present the underlying mathematics. And for sure, I will reject much of it, the mathematics about black holes, in my paper. But for now, I saw the papers and have observed how much mathematics I have to understand because of this. So biology for now. In a few days, I'll start Biological Sequence Analysis by Durbin et al, may be today itself.

<p><b>The proposal</b>

<p>The following model of the universe is proposed.
<p>The boundaries of the universe changes its size according to the following equation.
<p style="text-align: center"><i>x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> + z<sup>2</sup> = K<sup>2</sup>T<sup>2</sup>cos<sup>2</sup>&#952</i>
<p>The factor K may be a constant, or a variable. Through this equation, it is proposed that our universe undergoes cycles of big bangs and big crunches. It can be seen that it is an equation of a series of spheres.
<p>The term t represents the length of time from the mid point of the total time length and is a constant. So the current time
<p style="text-align: center">T<sub>current</sub> = T cos &#952
<p>x, y and z represent the 3-dimensional space coordinate limits. Assuming that x, y and z will remain equal at any point of time, their value being equal to the then radius of the universe.
<p style="text-align: center"><i>3r<sup>2</sup> = K<sup>2</sup>T<sup>2</sup>cos<sup>2</sup>&#952</i>
<p>So the radius of the universe
<p style="text-align: center"><i>r = <sup>T K Cos &#952</sup> &frasl; <sub>&#8730;2</sub></i>
<p>or, the half length of total time, from a big bang to the next big crunch
<p style="text-align: center"><i>T = <sup>&#8730;(2r)</sup> &frasl; <sub>K Cos &#952</sub></i>
<p>The diameter of the universe at a particular instance of time
<p style="text-align: center"><i>D = <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>&#8730;3</sub> T K Cos&#952</i>
<p>The rate of change of diameter with change with time can be represented as the rate of change of diameter with the angle &#952 whose cosine times the half time equals the current time.
<p style="text-align: center"><i><sup>dD</sup>&frasl;<sub>d&#952</sub> = <sup>-2</sup>&frasl;<sub>&#8730;3</sub> T K Sin&#952</i>
<p>Similarly, the equations for the surface area A and the volume V, we can derive the equations as follows.
<p style="text-align: center"><i>A = <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> &#960 T<sup>2</sup> K<sup>2</sup> Cos<sup>2</sup>&#952</i>
<p style="text-align: center"><i><sup>dA</sup>&frasl;<sub>d&#952</sub> = <sup>-8</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> &#960 T<sup>2</sup> K<sup>2</sup> Sin&#952 Cos&#952 &nbsp;&nbsp; or &nbsp;&nbsp; <sup>-4</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> &#960 T<sup>2</sup> K<sup>2</sup> Sin2&#952</i>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>V = <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>9&#8730;3</sub> &#960 T<sup>3</sup> K<sup>3</sup> Cos<sup>3</sup>&#952</i>
<p style="text-align: center"><i><sup>dV</sup>&frasl;<sub>d&#952</sub> = <sup>-4</sup>&frasl;<sub>3&#8730;3</sub> &#960 T<sup>3</sup> K<sup>3</sup> Cos<sup>2</sup>&#952 Sin&#952</i>
<p>To calculate the value and nature of the terms t and K, we need to look at the universe in a different way. The galaxies and supernovae that we have observed are not in the present. The image of the universe as we see is from the past. The more distance we are able to see into the universe, the more we enter into the past in our observations.
<p>If this fact is considered, we can get that these celestial bodies of the universe were moving away from us in past at the speed that we calculate today. The factor that is added which results to this observation is that since that point of time, the distance that we have travelled since that point of time.
<p>We can get the values of t and K if we keep the values that have been observed in a super accelerating universe at different distances. Looking into the past, we are not only increasing physical distance from ourselves, but also, are increasing the angle in time  from the present time that we live in.

<p><b>What do I need?</b>

<p>I need a list of all redshift readings uptil now. I also need understand the mathematics, what their notations are meaning. Then I will put the data and make a graph. I believe I will get the values of all the unknowns of my equations, for example the value of r, T, and K.
<p>And much more will be revealed.
