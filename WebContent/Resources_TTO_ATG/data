<p>My curiosity about myself and the creation whatever I see around myself has tempted me to start studying the nature in the most possible scientific and artistic way.
<p>I write each of my findings and readings and my thoughts over my findings on this website.
<p>I do not take any guarantee about the authenticity of anything that I write in here which comes under my opinion. All the data that is collected will be true and refferences will be quoted on the respective pages.
<p>I call this project "Towards the Origin" because I think my hunt for this knowledge will take me, and perhaps everyone else, to witness the origin of this universe, and themselves.
<p>I am a computer scientist. Welcome to my website. I hope you enjoy reading science in the most artistic and illogical way. I hope you visit this site again and again to get the updates and enjoy what I enjoy.
