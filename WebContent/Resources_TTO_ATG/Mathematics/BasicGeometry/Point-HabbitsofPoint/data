<h2 style="text-align: center">POINT - HABBITS OF POINT</h2>
<p>Point has been defined in the ancient texts in the following ways: [1]
<p style="margin-left: 150px;"> (1) A point is that which has no part. [Euclid]
<p style="margin-left: 150px;"> (2) A point is that which is indivisible into parts. [Aristotle]
<p style="margin-left: 150px;"> (3) A point is that part of which is nothing. [Martianus Capella]
<p>An entity which has no dimension, no magnitude and no position is called <b>monad</b>, but the one which is similarly indivisible but has a position is a <b>point</b>.
<p>A point is indivisible, so the assembly of points cannot form a line, because the line is a divisible magnitude. A line can be formed by the motion of a point. A point has no dimension and hence no weight, we can make no distinction between a point and a place. A point is the beginning of magnitudes and that from which they grow. A point is of one dimension and hence it does not spread itself. A point is same as <i>now</i> in time and a <i>unit</i> in number, because of being dimensionless. [1]
<p>Point is the only thing in the subject matter of geometry which is indivisible [Prolucus]. A point can grow only in one dimension.
